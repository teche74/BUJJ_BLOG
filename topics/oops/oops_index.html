  <!-- Introduction to OOP -->
  <div class="cloud-box">
    <p>
      Back in the early days of coding, most programs were written using something called <strong>procedural
        programming</strong>.
      This simply meant writing step-by-step instructions, like following a recipe. You define functions, give them
      data, and run them in order.
    </p>

    <p>
      While that worked fine for small programs, it got tricky as things got bigger. Since the code and the data it used
      were handled separately,
      managing complex programs became messy, especially when multiple parts needed to use or change the same data.
    </p>

    <p>
      To fix this, programmers came up with a better approach called <strong>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</strong>.
      It groups both data and related functions together into something called an <strong>object</strong>. This makes
      the code easier to organize, reuse, and understand.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- Classes -->
  <div class="classes cloud-box">
    <h1>Classes</h1>

    <p>
      A <strong>class</strong> is like a blueprint or template. It defines how something should behave and what it
      should contain ‚Äî like the attributes (e.g., name, color) and the behaviors (e.g., move, stop) of a car.
    </p>

      <figcaption class="caption">A real-world analogy: designing the idea of a car (class)</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      There are mainly two types of classes you‚Äôll hear about:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Concrete Classes</strong>: These are regular classes you can use to create real objects (instances).
      </li>
      <li><strong>Abstract Classes</strong>: These are incomplete classes that act like ideas or templates. You can't
        create objects from them directly ‚Äî they need more details first.</li>
    </ul>

      <figcaption class="caption">Concrete vs Abstract Class Overview</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p><em>We‚Äôll explore abstract classes more in upcoming sections. üòä</em></p>
  </div>

  <!-- Objects -->
  <div class="objects cloud-box">
    <h1>Objects</h1>

    <p>
      An <strong>object</strong> is like a real-world thing created from a class blueprint. It holds actual values and
      can do things using the functions defined in the class.
    </p>

    <figure class="concept-image">
      <img src="/assets/images/object_example.png" alt="Example of Object from real world object" />
      <figcaption class="caption">A real-world car object made from the 'Car' class</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      There are two main ways to create objects in languages like C++:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>1. Stack Object Creation:</strong><br>
        This is when you create the object directly in memory. It gets destroyed automatically when it goes out of
        scope.
        <pre class="code-block"><code>// C++ example
class Car {
public:
    void drive() { /* ... */ }
};

int main() {
    Car myCar; // Stack object
    myCar.drive();
    // myCar is destroyed automatically
}
</code></pre>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>2. Dynamic Object Creation:</strong><br>
        This method gives you more control. You create the object using <code>new</code> and must manually delete it to
        avoid memory leaks.
        <pre class="code-block"><code>// C++ example
Car* myCarPtr = new Car(); // Dynamic object
myCarPtr->drive();
delete myCarPtr; // You must delete it manually
</code></pre>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      üîÅ In short: <strong>stack objects</strong> are easy to manage, while <strong>dynamic objects</strong> give you
      more control but require extra care.
    </p>
  </div>


  <div class="class_components cloud-box">
    <h1>Class Components</h1>

    <p>A class contains multiple components:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Attributes (or Properties):</strong> These are the data or characteristics of the class, like a car's
        color or model. They define what the object can hold.</li>
    </ul>

    <figure class="class_compo_image">
      <img src="/assets/images/data_member.png" alt="Data Members" width="300px" />
      <figcaption class="caption">Data Members (Attributes)</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Methods (or Functions):</strong> These are the actions or behaviors the class can perform, like
        starting the engine or honking the horn. They define what the object can do.</li>
    </ul>

    <figure class="class_compo_image">
      <img src="/assets/images/member_function.png" alt="Member Function"/>
      <figcaption class="caption">Member Function (Behaviour)</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Constructors:</strong> These are special methods that run when you create an object. They set up the
        initial state of the object, like setting the car's color or model when you create a new car object.</li>
    </ul>

    <figure class="class_compo_image">
      <img src="/assets/images/constructor.png" alt="Constructor"  />
      <figcaption class="caption">Constructor Example</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Destructors:</strong> These are special methods that run when an object is destroyed. They clean up
        resources or perform any necessary final actions, like releasing memory or closing files.</li>
    </ul>

    <figure class="class_compo_image">
      <img src="/assets/images/destructor.png" alt="Destructor"  />
      <figcaption class="caption">Destructor Example</figcaption>
    </figure>


    <ul>
      <li><strong>Access Modifiers:</strong> These control how the class's attributes and methods can be accessed. They
        can be <strong>public</strong> (accessible from anywhere), <strong>private</strong> (accessible only within the
        class), or <strong>protected</strong> (accessible within the class and its subclasses).</li>
    </ul>

    <figure class="class_compo_image">
      <img src="/assets/images/access_modifier.png" alt="Access Modifier"  />
      <figcaption class="caption">Access Modifer and Who can Access Them</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Static Members and Functions:</strong> These belong to the class itself, not to any specific object. A
        <strong>static attribute</strong> is shared by all objects of the class, and a <strong>static method</strong>
        can be called without creating an object. For example, you might use a static variable to count how many objects
        have been created.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Friend Classes and Functions:</strong> These are special functions or classes that are allowed to
        access the private and protected members of another class. They are useful when two or more classes need to work
        closely together and share internal details, but you still want to keep those details hidden from the rest of
        the code.</li>
    </ul>
